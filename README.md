# Grafana Debugger

Idea:

Collect structured data about user Grafana problem in a fews steps (e.g. deployment, problem, documentation) and provide recommendations how/where user can solve the problem.

Example recommendations:
- if user has Grafana Enterprise (licensed) then offer "Email Grafana Enteprise recommendations", which generates email with all already submitted details (email subject is pregenerated by Grot AI)
- offer a chat with Grot AI, where initial post will contain all problem details in markdown format
- offer links to search on Community forum, Stack Overflow, Github Grafana issues, Google (InfluxData forum if 'Influx' string is in the problem) - (search query is pregenerated by Grot AI)
- offer link to create Community forum topic in nice markdown formated structure (title,topic,tags are pregenerated by Grot AI)

There can be other recommendations implemented:
e.g. if it is AMG - link to AWS support (AMG is supported by AWS), if problem contains 'volkovlabs' then recommend to contact https://volkovlabs.io/, ....

It can support all Grafana Labs products (Tempo, Loki, Pyroscope, ...).

It supports also Speech recognition API in the chat with Grot AI (if it is available in the browser, so available in Chrome, Edge, ...- try to say 'Show me example email notification template example. Send' - send/sent is keyword to trigger sent event)

It stores all problem details in the URL hash, so you can send link in email, chat, community post to anyone.

If user follow this proces (and if process will force/nudge to it) then the output will be good quality question/topic. It can improve initial support time (no need support ping pong, e.g. provide me your Grafana version, ...), it can be classified in the right category with right tags and with meaningful title (typical non meaningful title "I am newbie, help me!!!") - search engines will have better keywords for further indexing, ....
